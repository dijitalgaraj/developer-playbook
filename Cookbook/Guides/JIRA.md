# JIRA 
### Overview
JIRA is the project management tool we use in all development teams at Dijital Garaj. 

### How weâ€™re using it
We use Kanban for the projects that don't have too much tasks in backlogs.
Even though each project can be different we share some statuses between projects:

Common statuses:
* Backlog - Stories or bugs that will do in the future
* Selected For Development
* In Progress
* Waiting for test (WFT)
* Done

Journey starts with the planning:
* Analyze the stories
* If story can take more than 2 hours, break into small subtasks
* All subtasks should be testable and have a maximum estimation of 2 hours
* All subtask should have a time estimation 
* 1 week or 2 weeks tasks are moved to the 'Selected For Development' according to the priorities
* Version number should be set to these tasks.

### How we proceed
* Before beginning development, you should take a look at our [How to use git](HowToUseGit.md)
* Development starts with taking first task to the "In Progress"
* ##### If you finish the task, there are couple of things to do:
  * Always make your own tests before finishing
  * Enter the time you spent on this task as 'WorkLog'
  * Move task to the 'WFT'
  * Copy the jira issue number (ASMIOS-354), and use it in your <strong>git commit message</strong>
  * Also don't forget to push your commits after every task.
* ##### If you can not finish the task, there are couple of thing you should do, too:
  * Enter the time you spent on this task as 'WorkLog'
  * Enter a comment about what you do and why you stopped.
  * If task has a blocker, select the blocker task
  * If blocker task is not available, ask PM to open the blocker task
  * If someone else is going to continue on the task, assign the task
  * If you continue to work on the task you can stay it on In Progress
  * But if you will work on a different task, you should move the unfinished task to the 'Selected For Development'
